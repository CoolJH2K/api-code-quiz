## Description
Wanna test your coding knowledge? Look no further than this quiz! You will be asked many different questions relating to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a time limit of 90 seconds. But be careful! Any wrong answers you get will subtract ten seconds from the clock.
### Why did I make this?
I wanted to make a fun way for bootcamp students or other coders to memorize things relating to CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. It can also help them find out which areas they need to improve on.
### What problem does this solve?
They say that the best way for people to learn new things is to put fun in learning. Many people take online quizzes for fun, so it makes sense that making a little game out of memorizing coding things and trying to beat your personal best time would encourage people to study these things and memorize them better.
### What did I learn?
I learned a lot about how you can make a quiz by using JavaScript!
1. I discovered how to make a series of questions and how to assign the correct answer.
2. I learned how to set a timer using milliseconds.
3. Finally, I found out how to add event listeners (like mouse clicks) to different HTML elements.
